## Data Pipeline for [PROJECT_NAME] Dashboard Optimization

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
**Project Name**: [TO BE REPLACED BY: Specific project name, e.g., "Student Progress Analytics Pipeline"]

**Purpose**: This document outlines the requirements for building a data processing pipeline that transforms raw [TO BE REPLACED BY: Source system, e.g., "MongoDB collections"] data into optimized, query-ready collections for [TO BE REPLACED BY: Target dashboard/application, e.g., "student dashboard"] consumption.

**Business Value**: 
- Reduce dashboard page load times by [TO BE REPLACED BY: Expected improvement, e.g., "60-80%"]
- Offload complex aggregation logic from frontend requests
- Provide pre-aggregated, structured datasets for dashboard queries
- Establish scalable foundation for future reporting features

### 1.2 Current State vs. Target State

**Current State**:
- [TO BE REPLACED BY: Current architecture description, e.g., "Dashboard pages query directly from raw MongoDB collections"]
- Executes complex, unoptimized queries (e.g., aggregations for [TO BE REPLACED BY: Specific metrics])
- Increases query response time and server load
- Creates unnecessary coupling between frontend and raw data layer

**Target State**:
- [TO BE REPLACED BY: Target architecture description, e.g., "Dashboard APIs read from pre-processed collections"]
- Scheduled data processing via Airflow DAGs
- Optimized, indexed collections for dashboard consumption
- Decoupled frontend from raw data processing

3. **Reliability**: Achieve [TO BE REPLACED BY: Target uptime, e.g., "99.9%"] pipeline uptime
4. **Maintainability**: Enable easy addition of new metrics and data sources

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- **Query Performance**: [TO BE REPLACED BY: Specific metrics, e.g., "Average query time < 200ms"]
