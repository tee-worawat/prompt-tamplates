# 📚 Prompt Templates Collection

A public repository of prompt templates that I’ve created and shared across different projects.  
The goal is to keep them **organized, reusable, and open** for anyone who wants to learn or experiment with AI-assisted workflows.

## ✨ What’s Inside
- 🧑‍💻 **Engineering & Development Prompts**  
  For building data pipelines, dashboards, web apps, and more.  

- 📊 **Data Science & Analytics Prompts**  
  For analysis, visualization, experimentation, and reporting.  

- 🎮 **EdTech / CodeVenture Prompts**  
  Prompts designed for gamified learning platforms and computational thinking content.  

- 📄 **General Productivity Prompts**  
  Writing, planning, brainstorming, and documentation support.

## 🔑 How to Use
1. Browse the folders by category (e.g. `/engineering`, `/analytics`, `/edtech`).  
2. Copy the prompt template you need.  
3. Adapt it to your context by editing variables like `<DATASET_NAME>`, `<TECH_STACK>`, or `<TARGET_AUDIENCE>`.  
4. Run with your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## 🤝 Contributing
I’d love to make this a growing collection.  
- If you have prompt templates you’d like to share, open a PR!  
- Please follow the same format:  
  - **Filename:** short and descriptive  
  - **Header:** one-line purpose of the prompt  
  - **Body:** the actual prompt with placeholders in `<CAPS>`

## 📌 Disclaimer
- These prompts are shared publicly for learning and experimentation.  
- Always double-check AI outputs for correctness, especially in production.  
- Some prompts may need adjustments depending on the LLM you’re using.

## 🌟 Why This Repo?
Prompts are like reusable recipes. The more we share them, the faster we all learn to “cook” with AI.  
This repo is my open kitchen — feel free to use, adapt, and remix.
